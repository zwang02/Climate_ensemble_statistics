# NCAR Internal Variability Package

This repository is created with the goal of testing and building out a package for the NCAR Technical Note on Internal Variability. The publication is available [here](https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes%3A591). 


This is an on-going project and is being actively maintained. 

## Current to-dos:
- Separate Installation/Data Loading script from the notebook.

- Create "library" that takes in files and outputs the necessary dataframe

Functions to write:
- lib.input
- drop_year
